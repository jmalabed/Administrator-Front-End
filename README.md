###Summary
The Office Culture is a hotdesk administration software designed to integrate COVID precautionary protocol in a transparent and anonymous way.

When visiting an office, you are likely going in to meet people at the office rather than work in isolation. Because the work environment is so fluid since COVID-19, hotdesking is another common workplace norm. A typical visit to the office looks like this:

You are first greeted in the lobby by an admin that will typically sign you in to the building for security and Covid screening questions that are commonplace in today's work environment.

Next, you will migrate to an available (and clean) desk that you can work from. From there, you can make yourself at home while waiting for your meeting to get started.

You attend your meeting, and then head home before work traffic picks up in the afternoon.

The Office Culture handles all of this typical administrative functionality, but also integrates COVID-19 notifications to people that were present in the building at the same time as the reported person was.
